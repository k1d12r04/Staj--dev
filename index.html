      <h2> Why is a such a project needed ? </h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        With today's technology, the world of social media is expected to socialize us more, but it makes us more lonely day by day, and this problem causes individual and sometimes even society-based problems around the world. People can feel unhappy and lonely because of people who fall for false lives on social media and want to be like them, and people who try to show themselves as the happiest and most cheerful people on social media. With the increase of individualism under the pressure of modern capitalism, people communicate less, meet less, and chat less face to face.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        People are having a hard time finding friends now. Especially, people who want to find people with similar interests as their own do not hesitate to take advantage of the benefits of technology to achieve this. It shouldn't be too hard to find friends on many social media channels. It's hard for people to find someone with similar interests, with whom they can do something they love, and this project is an attempt to help people find the people they are looking for easily.
      </p>

      <h2>How is it different from others ?</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">Since this application is web-based, it does not require any download. This application, which is also easy to access with its catchy name, has set out with the aim of bringing together people with common interests. The website is very plain and simple to use and after just a few steps people can easily find what they are looking for. The site, which also gives people the opportunity to form their own groups, also offers the opportunity to use it for the purpose of acquiring a new hobby or self-development. For example, they can set up reading groups and organize book reading events, and they can both socialize and discover new books that are suitable for their interests, with activities such as going to book fairs and book exchanges. They can find the opportunity to escape from today's world, even for a short time, by joining cycling and trekking groups.</p>

    </section>
    <h2>General features and working principle</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Users who can easily register to the application can join the most suitable one from many groups divided into categories. If they can't find a suitable one, they can also create their own group in a few pretty simple steps. The purpose and participants of each group are written in the group information, and users can look at them and find the one that suits their purpose easily. While users are registering, the desired interest information is controlled by artificial intelligence algorithms and the most suitable groups for the user are displayed within seconds immediately after the user registers. Each group has a chat section and users can talk to other people in this section about events held in their group or just about their ideas.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Apart from being a member of a group, our application also offers the option of mentoring. People who want to be mentors fill in the mentoring form and send it to us by showing a document on the subject they are competent or reporting the work they have done so far. We also evaluate the form and if we deem it appropriate, we give the person a mentor account. These mentors can join the groups and lead them upon requests from the groups, give training, homework or supervision if requested by the group members, and request periodic reports.
